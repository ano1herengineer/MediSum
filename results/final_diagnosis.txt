### Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of anxiety, family history of generalized anxiety disorder, and current symptoms of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, and fear of having a heart attack may indicate an underlying anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, which is supported by the reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist.
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's GERD could be causing chest pain and discomfort, which may be mistaken for cardiac issues, and may also be contributing to respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, due to acid reflux irritating the lungs or airways, as suggested by the Cardiologist and Pulmonologist reports.
* **Hyperventilation Syndrome**: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating could be related to hyperventilation, which is often associated with anxiety, and is supported by the reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, who all suggest that the patient's anxiety and stress levels may be contributing to their symptoms.
